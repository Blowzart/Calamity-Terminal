The installation process is simple if your on arch or an arch based system otherwise you have to follow these steps.

To install on arch run the INSTALL.sh file with sudo ./INSTALL.sh 

On every other distro 

sudo [packagemanager] [installation keyword] python
then run the Calamity.sh 

for arch it will automatically install and run it keep in mind you have to be in the directory of the installed files.

Happy using!
